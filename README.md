# Trilogic.Common.IniSettings
A very simple .NET library to read and write INI files.

The code does not rely on any Windows API functions so it can be used on any platform.  If you enjoy the simplicity of .INI files versus putting settings in XML config files then this library may be useful to you.  The original code was written in the beta release of C# and maintained through Visual Studio 2005.
